# Container Security

The goal of this project is to analyze container images in a complete way, focusing on both static and dynamic analysis, and also including some monitoring activities. This is achieved with the creation of workflows that leverage several open-source tools. <br>

The repository contains three main folders: <b>static</b>, <b>dynamic</b> and <b>monitoring</b>. Each folder contains a description, an installation guide and some usage examples. <br>

In order for the scripts to work some programs need to be installed. While it might seem a bit tedious or overwhelming at first, most of these tools are quick and easy to set up, and not all of them are required (Eg. If a user is only interested in the static analysis of python applications he  can download the tools required for that workflow).
